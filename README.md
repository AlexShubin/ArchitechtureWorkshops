# ArchitechtureWorkshops

## Intro

Workshops are designed to give developers who have no experience with Swift an overview of modern iOS-apps development and share with more experienced iOS-developers knowledge about unidirectional architectures and particularly [Composable Architecture](https://github.com/pointfreeco/swift-composable-architecture).

Workshops require professional programming knowledge. If you have no experience with Swift it's okay. You can drop if at any time they get harder. And vice versa; you can join any time by checking out the latest commit in this repo.

## Workshops plan

We'll be building a slightly modified version of Babbel's code challenge. Here's the app interface:

### We'll go through:

 1. Building a basic game app using SwiftUI
 2. Solving UI/Logic separation problems
 3. Introducing the app state and sharing it between different scenes
 4. Introducing the app state reducer
 5. Building and testing service layer
 6. Introducing side-effects and Composable Architecture
 7. Introducing Reducers composition, using Composable Architecture to modularize the app
 8. Testing the app modules

## Setup

Setup Xcode 11.6 (should be the latest version from the App Store). Make sure you ran it at least once in order to install "Additional Components" (you'll be guided).
